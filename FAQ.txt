1. So do I need multiple accounts in order to use multiple workers?
	-Yes. Put all of them into the usersettings.json file and set them to the same id.
	
2. Should I aim for a 100% scan under 15 minutes? Is that a good way to decide how many workers?
	-Yes for data collecting a time under 15 minutes is good for the first run. subsequent runs will also be faster,
	because of removed empty cells. For hunting/live map purposes 5 minutes would be better as mark.
	
3. For a continuous area larger than -r 30? What is the best, increase the radius and workers or a split in different id's?
	-You want that whole area, don't split. You want parts of it, better split it, i.e. run multiple instances
	of the tool with different ids. Empty areas get removed in subsequent runs, don't worry about those.
	
4. Do the id's still attach on each other or I have to estimate on google maps?
	-They don't attach and in most cases it's better to just use one id anyway.
	If you want them to attach, yes you'll have to use google maps.

5. I just want to set it up efficiently for area XXX and do XXX, but I am unsure for example, how many accounts I would need.
	-See question 3. Scan time decreases linearly with the amount of workers, twice the workers, half the time.
	Also increases quadratically with scan range, twice the range, four times the duration.
	Try it out with some workers and just use a good estimate.
	
6. I have many empty cells, is that bad?
	-Water cells are mostly empty, but even in cities you have some empty cells and in rural areas you have many of them as well.
	They will be removed during the first scan and make subsequent ones faster.
	
7. What is that time format? How can I convert it into something readable?
	-It's the timezone independent unix time, you can easily transform that into any local time format. Example: http://www.unixtimestamp.com/
	
8. How are empty cells removed? I'm worried, that it removes non-empty cells.
	-When the servers return an empty location, it rescans up to 5 times immediately after that in a 1 second interval. So only coming up empty for all of these scans gets an area removed as empty.
	It may not be perfect, but for me the non-empty cells only came to a maximum of try 3 until servers sent them back non-empty. If you're worried, increase the "tries" variable in main0.py to
	something like 10, but it will increase the scan time during the first scan.
	The criterium for a location being empty is all of the surrounding cells having no pokemon things at all inside, so it doesn't depend on where exactly you scan or when.
	Also cells are only removed during the first run, because logically there can't be empty ones in the subsequent ones.
	Right now removed locations are not being stored, so if you restart the tool, it'll rescan everything.
	
9. "Error: The settings file is not in a valid format, No JSON object could be decoded." Any advice?
	-You messed up the settings file format. Validate the file with this: http://jsonlint.com/
	Mind your commas and brackets, don't use fancy quotation marks. Change it step by step and revalidate to find the error.
